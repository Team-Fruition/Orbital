<h3> 
	Project Description 
</h3>

> <p> 	This game is a top-down 2D space-shooter, with a slightly
> different take on the bullet hell genre. <p />
> 
> <p> 	For those that have heard of games like Solomon's Boneyard and
> Amorphous+, this game will have similar mechanics, with a controllable
> camera instead of having the usual  linearly scrolling backdrop
> featuring in most arcade bullet hell variants. </p>
> 
> <p> Currently, this game only works on Windows. Once we get our
> hands on a Mac machine, we would be able to get a Mac-runnable version
> of the game. </p>

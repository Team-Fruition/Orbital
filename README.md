<h3> 
	Project Description 
</h3>

> <p> 	This game is a top-down 2D space-shooter, with a slightly
> different take on the bullet hell genre. <p />
> 
> <p> 	For those that have heard of games like Solomon's Boneyard and
> Amorphous+, this game will have similar mechanics, with a controllable camera instead of having the usual 
> linearly scrolling backdrop featuring in most arcade bullet hell variants. </p>

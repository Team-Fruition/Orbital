<h3> 
	Project Description 
</h3>

> <p> 	This game is a top-down 2D space-shooter, with a slightly
> different take on the bullet hell genre. <p />
> 
> <p> 	For those that have heard of games like Solomon's Boneyard and
> Amorphous+, this game will have similar mechanics, with a controllable
> camera instead of having the usual  linearly scrolling backdrop
> featuring in most arcade bullet hell variants. </p>

<h3>
	Project Details
</h3>

<h4>
	Scope
</h4>

> <p> This game is aimed at anybody with free time. Which is everyone. </p>

<h4>
	 Project Scope
</h4>

> Really only limited by time and motivational constraints. As of now the game is "completed", but why stop here?  

<h4>
	Targeted Level of Acheivement
</h4>

> We are aiming for the Project Gemini level achievement. We would like this achievement because everything besides the [Music](http://youtu.be/1rC7pNgxkZU), down to the Art Assets and the Code Structure itself, was 99% original. But if it's not worthy we understand :)

<h4>
	Things Done
</h4>

>  1. Main Menu State
>  2. Help Screen State
>  3. Base Game State
>  4. Base Pause State
>  5. Player HUD
>  5. Background Music
>  6. Game Over State

<h4>
	Things Not Done (should hopefully be implemented by Splashdown)
</h4>

>  1. A visible notification which indicates to the Player that a new Weapon has been unlocked.
>  2. Bug fixing.

<h4>
	Possible Future Extensions (which are unlikely to get pursued)
</h4>

>  1. Making the standalone game playable on Mac and Ubuntu.
>  2. Multiplayer -> Leaderboard.
>  3. An "Options" Menu, with adjustable sound.
>  4. More content past the 5th difficulty.
>  5. A prettier Help Screen.

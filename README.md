<h3> 
	Project Description 
</h3>

> <p> 	This game is a top-down 2D space-shooter, with a slightly
> different take on the bullet hell genre. <p />
> 
> <p> 	For those that have heard of games like Solomon's Boneyard and
> Amorphous+, this game will have similar mechanics, with a controllable camera instead of having the usual 
> linearly scrolling backdrop featuring in most arcade bullet hell variants. </p>

<h3>
	Project Details
</h3>

<h4>
	Scope
</h4>

> <p> 	This game is aimed at anybody with free time.  </p>

<h4>
	Targeted Level of Acheivement
</h4>

> <p> 	We are aiming for the Project Gemini level achievement. </p>

<h4>
	Things Done
</h4>

>  1. Main Menu State
>  2. Help Screen State

<h4>
	Things Not Done (should hopefully be implemented by end June)
</h4>

>  1. Audio Implementation (now it's really simulating the silence of space)
>  2. Game State
>  3. Game Over State 
>  4. Pause State

<h4>
	Possible Future Extensions
</h4>

>  1. Converting the whole Pygame app into a Kivy app.

<h4>
	To Run 
</h4>

>  1. For now, you will have to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
> [Pygame](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame).
>  2. To install the Pygame module (which is a .whl file), follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnpC_Ib_lbc). Because some
> modules will conflict with each other, you might want to install
> Pygame onto a different folder/virtual environment. 
>  3. Clone this entire repo. You can use the [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) client for this.
>  4. Double click main.py within the Project_Files folder to run.
